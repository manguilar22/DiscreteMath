		(Chapter 7: Matrices {What is a matrix, Fundamental Operations on Matrices})
			> Matrices were invented by Arthur Cayley (1821-1895), which he personally thought were useless at the time. Fortunately, for Arthur matrices are used in many fields. Matrices give the ability to analyze data in diffrent ways, because matrices allow to be combined in many ways. A matrix is a rectangular representation of a set of numbers. Other variables are allowed to be substituted in. A matrix follows the format of m x n , which is m rows and n columns. MULTIPLICATION OF MATRICES IS NOT COMMUTATIVE.   
		(Chapter 8: Graph Theory {Introduction, Fundamental Ideas of Graphs})
			> A graph, is a collection of points called edges that form vertices in space. 
		(Chapter 9: Number Theory {Divisibility, Primes, Modular Arithemtic}) 
			> Number theory, is the study of the properties of all natural numbers.

* Computation
	> Mathematica
	> List/Vector -> Matrix <-> Graph
		|Define, List ...
			> Lists are central constructs in the Wolfram Language, used to represent collections, arrays, sets, and sequences of all kinds. Lists can have any structure and size and can routinely involve even millions of elements. Well over a thousand built-in functions throughout the Wolfram Language operate directly on lists, making lists a powerful vehicle for interoperability.
		|Define, Matrix ...
			> Matrices are represented in the Wolfram Language with lists. The Wolfram Language also has commands for creating diagonal matrices, constant matrices, and other special matrix types.
		|Define, Graph ...
