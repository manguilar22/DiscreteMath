#	* EXPLAIN THE GOALS OF YOUR PROJECT			#
#	* Indicate why this topic is exciting and useful	#
#	* Introduce your project and outline importance
# * Why is this topic useful/exciting             	#

  Goals in the project is to demonstrate the importance of numbers in the real world.
  Example being how conglomerate enterprises rely heavly on the security of their products.
  Consumers who purchase services from companies need to trust that their account information is secure.
  Companies built a reputation on the integrity and credibility of their services, making cryptography
  important to the eco-system of trading goods and services.
  Since, cryptography has become exclusive to the realm of digital systems by generating different formats of
  verifying information; to checksums, qr-codes, and identicons.


#	|Background						#
#	* Background information required to understand 	#

  As all scientific topics, a plethora of vocabulary words must be known to be versitle in the science.
  Cryptography has a rich history; from the humble origin of "shifting" ciphers of Julius Ceaser to
  the modern AES algorithm.
  Define, HASH ____________________________________
	Hashing is the transformation of a digital object into fixed value. A key that represent the original object. Hashing is used to index and retrieve information that may be sensitive in nature and requires validiation. 
  Define, ENTROPY____________________________________
	Entropy is the randomness collected by an operating system or application for use in cryptography or other cases requiring random data. 
  Define, CHECKSUMS__________________________________
	Checksums are used as a verification token when downloading applications from the internet. It it helps the consumer by verifiying the original application is untampered. A checksum is a hash of the whole application.
  Define, Symmetric ____________________________________
	Encryption is a form of computerized cryptography using a singular encryption key to guise an electronic message. Its data conversion uses a mathematical algorithm along with a secret key, which results in the inability to make sense out of a message.
  Define, Asymmetric ____________________________________
	Asymmetric encryption is a method of encryption known as a "third-party" system. Two encrypted objects are generated; a public and a private key. The propetary of the asymmetric lock will be the only one with access to the private key. The public key will be distributed across the web and to whomever it concerns. This with the purpose to offer a form of security for the user. The entity in posession of the private key will be able to verify the legitamitcy of the encrypted object by decrypting. Decrypting is allowed using the private if the original message was signed with the public key. 
  Define, Public Key ____________________________________
  Define, Private Key __________________________________
  Define, QR-Code ______________________________________
  Define, Identicon ___________________________________
  Define, ByteArray ___________________________________
  Define, Number Theory ________________________________
	Number Theory, is the study of numbers and their properties.

  The Wolfram Language's extensive base of state-of-the-art algorithms and
  efficient handling of very long integers make it uniquely suited to both research and 
  implementation of cryptographic number theory.
	When reading complimentary material for the project based on the nature of the numbers it was intresting to visualize the ideas. As I learned Wolfram Language it became easy and clear to translate the ideas from paper and ink to the digital. 
	Research in the topic is crucial in today's society rotating around digital devices. Research in this field can be transfered to the benfit of the city by generating validation key for key cards. An large number of business in the El Paso rely on smart authentication cards. 
	Real life example of supercomputing, 
	Real life example of crytography, 
	Cryptography is important, it is used in all forms of electronic media. We use it in our emails, social media accounts and to verify our passwords. Cryptography also offers an extra layer of security in the Information Technology world. By using public keys on trusted devices and verifying them when they connect to the internet. Using the domain name of the network configured with a provate key to verify the electronic device is allowed to browse the web or communicate with other devices. 

#	|Conclusion 						#
#	* What new knowledge was aquired. 			#
# 	* Why is your project excitig/useful 			#
#	* Connections between what you learned so far ... 	#

	Knowledge was aquired with respect to the property numbers in realtion to cryptography. 
	Knowledge was aquired in respect with scientific computing....
	The project is useful because it uses cloud --  an enterprise solution for resource disapition. Resources , 
in the context of reducing infrastructure costs and increasing profit.
