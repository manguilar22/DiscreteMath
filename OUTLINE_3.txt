#	|Introduction
#	* EXPLAIN THE GOALS OF YOUR PROJECT			#
#	* Indicate why this topic is exciting and useful	#
#	* Introduce your project and outline importance
# * Why is this topic useful/exciting             	#

  Goals in the project is to demonstrate the importance of numbers in the real world.
  Example being how conglomerate enterprises rely heavly on the security of their products.
  Consumers who purchase services from companies need to trust that their account information is secure.
  Companies built a reputation on the integrity and credibility of their services, making cryptography
  important to the eco-system of trading goods and services.
  Since, cryptography has become exclusive to the realm of digital systems by generating different formats of
  verifying information; to checksums, qr-codes, and identicons.


#	|Background						#
#	* Background information required to understand 	#

  As all scientific topics, a plethora of vocabulary words must be known to be versitle in the science.
  Cryptography has a rich history; from the humble origin of "shifting" ciphers of Julius Ceaser to
  the modern AES algorithm.

#	|Main Section						                      #
#	* What did you learn ? 					              #
#	* How does this have to do with your major		#
#	* Connect it to the real world or community		#
# 	* Do you intend to present this project to an audience  #
#	* References ? 						#
#	* REAL-LIFE EXAMPLES must be included			#

  The Wolfram Language's extensive base of state-of-the-art algorithms and
  efficient handling of very long integers make it uniquely suited to both research and 
  implementation of cryptographic number theory.
